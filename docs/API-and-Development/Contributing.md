# Contributing to RomM

Thank you for considering contributing to RomM! This document outlines some guidelines to help you get started with your contributions.

**If you're looking to implement a large feature or make significant changes to the project, it's best to open an issue first AND join the Discord to discuss your ideas with the maintainers.**

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold this code.

## AI Assistance Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to RomM, it must be disclosed in the pull request.

If you are using any kind of AI assistance while contributing to RomM **this must be disclosed in the pull request**, along with the extent to which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation). If PR responses are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well. As a small exception, trivial tab-completion doesn't need to be disclosed.

An example disclosure:

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

Or a more detailed disclosure:

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution
> was fully authored manually by myself.

Failure to disclose this is rude to the human operators on the other end of the pull request, but it also makes it difficult to determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.

In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in most cases it's generating slop.

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.

## Contributing to the Docs

If you would like to contribute to the project's [documentation](https://docs.romm.app), open a pull request against [the docs repo](https://github.com/rommapp/docs). We welcome any contributions that help improve the documentation (new pages, updates, or corrections).

## Adding Translations

If you would like to translate the project into another language, create a new folder under the `frontend/src/locales` directory, and follow the existing language files as a template. Once you've created the new language file, open a pull request to add it to the project.

7. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin feature-or-fix-name`
8. Open a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository.
