RomM provides support for various forms of authentication, granting flexibility in securing access to its features.

### Setup

You'll want to set the following environment variable before starting RomM:

- `ROMM_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` is required and can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`

### Sessions

When the `/login` endpoint is called with valid credentials, a `session_id` is generated, stored as a cookie and sent to the browser. The same token is used to create a cache entry in Valkey (or in-memory if Valkey is disabled) which maps the token to the user. This way no sensitive information is stored on the client.

### Roles

A user can have one of the following roles:

- VIEWER: Can view platforms and ROMs, download ROMs, and edit own profile
- EDITOR: Can create/edit/delete platforms and ROMs
- ADMIN: Can view all users, and create/edit/disable/delete users

As permissions are additive, editors will have all permissions of the `viewer` role, and admins all those of the `editor` role.

## Basic Authentication

Requests can be made to protected API endpoints with an authorization header. The token is the base64 encoded value of `username:password`.

Example using cURL:

```bash
curl https://romm.local/api/platforms -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46aHVudGVyMg=='
```

## OAuth

Along with the above forms of authentication, we've added an endpoint to generate expiring, scope-limited authentication tokens (`/api/token`). Successfully authenticating with that endpoint with return an `access_token` valid for 15 minutes, and a [`refresh_token`](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/) valid for 2 weeks. The `refresh_token` can be used to generate a new `access_token` when needed.

The `/api/token` endpoint requires a username, password, and a list of [scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) in the format `read:roms write:roms read:platforms ...`. The list of scopes and endpoints are available to browse via Swagger UI or ReDoc (see next section).

**Note: As of now, only the legacy [password grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/) is supported.** We plan to eventually add support for [Client Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/).

### OpenAPI

The API endpoints are fully documented and compliant with the OpenAPI specification. Explore the API endpoints using the Swagger UI interface at `/api/docs` and the ReDoc interface at `/api/redoc`, or view the raw JSON at `/openapi.json`.

## FAQ

### Can I disable authentication?

No, authentication is required and enabled by default.

### I want to allow an EDITOR to edit ROMs but not delete them. Can I do that?

At this time, fine-grain control over permissions within a role is not supported. This decision was taking in order to simplify user management in the client, and authentication/permission code on the server.

### Is authentication safe/robust? Can I trust it?

We've done our best to build an authentication system that is simple, clear and comprehensible. We have automated tests which verify that access is granted when it should be, and blocked when not (invalid credentials, missing permissions, expired access tokens, etc.). That being said, we welcome any reviews of our authentication and permission flows, PRs to fix issues, and new tests to cover edge cases.

### I found an bug/issue with authentication. How do I report it?

Please report bugs in our authentication/permission system privately by [submitting a vulnerability report](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/security/advisories/new).
