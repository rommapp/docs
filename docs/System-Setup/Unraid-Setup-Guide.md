## Prerequisites

Before getting started, install the [Community Apps plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38582-plug-in-community-applications/) for Unraid.

### Docker network

You'll want to create a custom bridge-type network for both containers to communicate with each other. This will prevent a number of common issues Unraid users tend to come across during setup. This can be done with the following command: `docker network create romm`, and you can verify it worked with `docker network ls`.

### MariaDB

MariaDB is required to run RomM, so install it from the plugin registry. Only the [official](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) and [linuxserver](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mariadb/pkgs/container/mariadb) versions are supported, but **the official version is preferred**.

Now fill in all the environment variables; descriptions of the options and sensible defaults are listed in the [example docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.example.yml) file.

## Installation

From the Unraid dashboard, click `APPS` in the navigation bar. In the search bar, search for `romm`, and install the app listed as "OFFICIAL". This one is maintained by our team and is the most up-to-date.

## Configuration

Configure the required environment variables, ports and paths as per the [example docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.example.yml) file.

    The network type must also be set to `Custom: romm`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note
    As of **v4.1.0**, `RomM` now **requires a valid `config.yml`** file to be present **before startup**.  
    Make sure your `config.yml` is properly configured and mounted into the container. 
    Refer to the [configuration documentation](https://docs.romm.app/latest/Getting-Started/Configuration-File/) for details.

Apply the changes, then head to the `DOCKER` tab. You should see both containers in a running state, and can access RomM using the IP:PORT of the container (highlighted below).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning
    It's strongly recommended to backup the `appdata` folder (or mount it in a safe location) before updating, since tearing down the container will wipe the resources (covers, screenshots, etc.)
