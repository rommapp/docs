The Administration panel contains the tools used to manage users on the server. The first user created will always be given the admin role.

Users can manage their own game saves, save states, their profile icon, and the "Personal" data tab on games.

## Adding Users

Adding a user is as simple as providing a username, password, email address, and selecting a role. Users can be added manually using the "Add" button or by inviting a user via link. When inviting a user, you only need to set a role; they will be prompted to complete the rest of the information.

### Roles Explained

**Admin** - The highest authority role. This grants full permission to do everything on the server.

**Editor** - Can edit platforms and games (adding, removing, or scanning for new content) and make collections public.

**Viewer** - The most restricted role. Can play games and interact with the Personal data tab.

## Removing Users

Removing a user is as simple as clicking the red delete icon and confirming the operation.
